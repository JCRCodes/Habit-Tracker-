# Pseudocode for Habit Tracker Database Schema:

# Purpose: Define the structure and relationship between tables 

----------------------------
TABLES
----------------------------

Table: Users

Purpose:
- Stores information for each person using the app

Fields:
- user_id        → Primary Key (auto-increment integer)
- firstname       → Text, must be unique
- email          → Text
- created_at     → DateTime, default to current date

Note: Each user can create multiple logs 

----------------------------

Table: Habits

Purpose:
- Stores the habits each user wants to track

Fields:
- habit_id       → Primary Key (auto-increment integer)
- user_id        → Foreign Key referencing Users.user_id
- habit_name     → Text
- description    → Text
- category       → Text (e.g., health, productivity)
- frequency      → Text (e.g., daily, weekly)
- start_date     → Date
- created at     → DateTime (auto-generated)

Notes:
- One user can have many habits
- Each habit is associated with one user

----------------------------

Table: Habit Logs

Purpose:
- Stores daily records of whether a user completed a habit

Fields:
- log_id         → Primary Key (auto-increment integer)
- habit_id       → Foreign Key referencing Habits.habit_id
- log_date       → Date
- habit status   → BIT (1 = completed, 0 = not completed)
- note           → Text (optional)
- logged at      → date time (auto-generated)

Notes:
- One habit can have many log entries (one per day)
- Each log belongs to one habit

RELATIONSHIPS
----------------------------
- Users → Habits (One-to-Many)
- Habits → Habit_Logs (One-to-Many)

Logical Flow:
1. User signs up → saved in Users
2. User creates a habit → saved in Habits with link to user_id
3. User logs habit completion → saved in Habit_Logs with link to habit_id

----------------------------
EXAMPLE:
----------------------------
- A user named "Jess" signs up
- Jess creates a habit "Meditate" under the category "Health"
- On May 28th, Jess logs the habit as completed with a short note in her log

System stores:
- Jess in Users
- "Meditate" in Habits with Jess’s user_id
- A new row in Habit_Logs for May 28 with status = 1
